    <h2>Rorik</h2>
    <p>I'm a random guy who enjoys little things. As early Gen-z (28yo), I had access to a computer and internet relatively soon</p>
    <p>In 2015 I studied archaeology, but it was not for me really, so I decided to break with the university and started a technical formation in 2019 about Software Development</p>
    <p>Since a little kid I spent hours in the computer, playing games, emulating GBA, and customizing my OS (Windows). When I was around 13yo, I started a YouTube channel about little gamplays and stuff I found fun, like LEGO. I did take part of a small yet awesome YT community, where I found a lot of cool people to play Steam games and talking thorugh Skype.</p>
    <p>I started using Twitter in 2012, when I began my most socially-active era on the internet. I was very active between 2016 to 2023. It did bring me great stuff, but also a very little intentional use, which eventually did lead on a kind of addictivite use. Also the thing stopped being fun when Musk took over. By late 2024, I moved completely to Bluesky.</p>
    <p>As of today, I consider I have a more balanced life. I've some interests like movies, hiking, running and traveling when I can.
        I like to spend quality time with friends and partner, but I still enjoy being alone a lot. I use to listen to a lot of music, specially instrumental, rock, new age and others.
        Mike Oldfield and Bowie are two artists I listen to a lot, but I'm not fan of many artists in specific. I'm more into movies than into music by a lot, that's for sure, specially drama, thrillers, and also some adventure movies. I'm very active on Letterbox, you can find the link at the main page.
    </p>
    <p>I've been working in different consultancy positions since 2020, but I will probably want to be a freelance in the future as I don't like corporations and vertical structures at all.</p>
    <p>Also I love coffee, so please feel free to buy me one :D</p>
